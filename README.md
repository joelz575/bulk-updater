# bulk-updater
  
  The bulk-updater assists in copying/overwriting large amounts of files. Two directories are needed for execution, one with the files to update and one with the files that are used as a template for the update. Files that are to be skipped may also be specified as a comma-separated list.
  
  All files are overwritten/created in the new directory if needed.
  
  By changing the input source for the scanner in the main function, one may use either the Terminal to enter the values or a .txt file, as demostrated using swatplus.txt.
