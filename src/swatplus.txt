Explanation:

main.f90 & time_control.f90 & CMakeLists.txt: include Tinamit specific code

cbn_zhang2.f90: throws error when update is run so it is updated manually

ru_module.f90: the bitbucket files for swat+ are erroneous;
 they delete "uhs" from this file which is required by the rest of the model

hru_module.f90: the bitbucket files for swat+ are erroneous;
 they delete "lai_yrmx" from this file which is required by the rest of the model
